If a British national needs to travel more urgently, they may be able to apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD).</p>\n\n<p>Anyone applying for an ETD or needing consular assistance should phone the British Embassy on +95 (0)1 370 863, +95 (0)1 370 864 or +95 (0)1 370 865 and follow the instructions to speak a consular officer who will assist you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"disabled-access\">Disabled access</h2>\n\n<p>The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and this Embassy are keen to ensure that their buildings and services are fully accessible to disabled members for the public.  Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible.  Sometimes however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions.  In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people.  To assist disabled visitors, we have set out below details of access for the disabled at this Embassy.  We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General physical access</h3>\n<p>Access to the Embassy building is constrained by security considerations and the current layout of access routes and facilities.  However, reception and security staff are alert to the requirements of disabled visitors and will endeavor to ensure that disable visitors are provided with appropriate assistance during their visit to ensure that they have access to Embassy services.</p>\n\n<p>If you anticipate requiring assistance, please telephone in advance of your visit so that we can ensure that we are able to provide access for you:</p>\n\n<p>Telephone: +95 (0) 1370863 and ask for the Security Manager or</p>\n\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:Management.Rangoon@fco.gov.uk\">Management.Rangoon@fco.gov.uk</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"public-holidays\">Public holidays</h2>\n<p>The Embassy will be CLOSED on the following days in 2018.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>New Year’s Day\t\t\t\t1 January\t  Monday</li>\n  <li>Independence Day\t\t\t4 January\t  Thursday</li>\n  <li>Good Friday\t\t\t\t\t30 March Friday</li>\n  <li>Easter Monday\t\t\t\t02 April\tMonday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t        13 April  Friday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t        16 April  Monday</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Water Festival\t\t17 April Tuesday</li>\n  <li>May Day\t\t\t\t        1 May Tuesday</li>\n  <li>Hari Raya Haji\t\t\t        22 August Wednesday</li>\n  <li>Summer Bank Holiday\t\t        27 August Monday</li>\n  <li>Fullmoon day of Thindayut\t\t24 October Wednesday</li>\n  <li>Diwali Day\t\t\t\t\t07 November   Wednesday</li>\n  <li>Fullmoon day of Tazaunboner      22 November   Thursday</li>\n  <li>Christmas Day\t\t               25 December   Tuesday</li>\n  <li>Boxing Day\t\t\t\t       26 December   Wednesday</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>",
