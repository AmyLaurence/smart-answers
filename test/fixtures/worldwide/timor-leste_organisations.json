Wherever possible, we have made our buildings and services accessible. Sometimes, however, this is not possible due to security or other restrictions. In these situations we will endeavour to provide a service or access to a building in an alternative way to ensure equality of access for disabled people. To assist disabled staff and visitors, we have set out below details of disabled access at the Consulate. We hope this information is helpful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-physical-access\">General Physical Access</h3>\n<p>There is a disabled access through the pedestrian entrance into the public waiting room. If you require assistance, please telephone us in advance of your visit on +62 (0) (21) 2356 5200. Wheelchair access to and from the Consulate is via the main entrance.
